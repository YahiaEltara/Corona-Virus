# Corona-Virus
This project is about Corona Virus.
First step I did is to understand the data and it was easy. Then, I read the requirements to prepare the questions in my mind during every process. After that, I decided to check data duplications & null values if it existed. It was asked to replace null values with zero. After all of that, answering the questions and some of it was kind of difficult but I answer it all in the end.
